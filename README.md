# Wechat-Moments-Scraper
Scraper for wechat moments.

# Usage
1. Setup a Postgres database and edit the connection variables at the top of Scraper.py.
2. Edit the MAX_PYQ post for number of posts to scrape. I suggest staying below 200.
3. Open wechat moments window and run the program.
4. The program will stop upon reaching the week mark, as the time accuracy would be too low.
5. Render the data..? Data processing module coming soon
## CAN ONLY BE USED ON WINDOWS!!! ##

Other two files are for legacy CSV version. Don't use them, probably.

Will probably have some unexpected bugs, look through the adomination if you want... But overall, it should work fine.
