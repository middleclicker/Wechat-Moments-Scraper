# Wechat-Moments-Scraper
Scraper for wechat moments.

# Usage
Setup a Postgres database and edit the variables at the top of Scraper.py. Open wechat moments window and run the program.
Edit the MAX_PYQ post for number of posts to scrape. I suggest staying below 200. The program will stop upon reaching the week mark, as the time accuracy would be too low.
## CAN ONLY BE USED ON WINDOWS!!! ##

Other two files are for legacy CSV version. Don't use them, probably.

Will probably have some unexpected bugs, look through the adomination if you want... But overall, it should work fine.
