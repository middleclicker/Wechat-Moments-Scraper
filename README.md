# Wechat-Moments-Scraper
Scraper for wechat moments.

# Credits:
  - https://github.com/HYLZ-2019/FriendsOfFriends used as base.

# Usage
1. Setup a Postgres database and edit the connection variables at the top of Scraper.py.
2. Edit the MAX_PYQ post for number of posts to scrape. I suggest staying below 200.
3. Open wechat moments window and run the program.
4. The program will stop upon reaching the week mark, as the time accuracy would be too low.
5. Render the data..? Data processing module coming soon
## CAN ONLY BE USED ON WINDOWS!!! ##

Data you can expect

Will probably have some unexpected bugs, look through the adomination if you want... But overall, it should work fine.

# Todo
- ~~Fix this abomination~~ Added comments, fixed logic errors

- Add data processing module
- ~~Code cleanup overall... Probably a full rewrite of many areas~~ Best I can do for now
